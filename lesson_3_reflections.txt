When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate with yourself (work is saved in multiple places and accessible from multiple places)
    To collaborate and share with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not want changes pulled (whether or not they're complete).

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone is a copy of a repo on your local machine: for working on entirely your own repo.
    Fork is used when you want to greate a new project from a current project.
    Branches are used for side/feature development and may be deleted or merged later.    

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Hmmm.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Projects would have to be sent or you would work on branches then merge.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Yes, experimenting and working on features is good use for a branch.
